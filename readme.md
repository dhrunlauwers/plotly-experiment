# Portfolio Optimization with Dash

A few months ago I did a simple [example of portfolio optimization in matplotlib](https://github.com/dhrunlauwers/markowitz-portfolio-optimization). 

More recently, I used the same algorithm, applied real data from 20 companies, and created a [web app in Dash](http://dhrunlauwers.pythonanywhere.com) to share the results with others. 

Not sure how far I'll take this example, but I have a feeling there will be more Dash in my future.
